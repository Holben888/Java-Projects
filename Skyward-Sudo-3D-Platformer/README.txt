This program was created using the Eclipse IDE with GUI graphics generated with coordinate manipulation in Java.
Running Driver.java from the command line will generate a 500 x 700px window with keyboard input to move the player along the tiles.

Though a 2D graphics library was used, tiles that appear 3-Dimensional are created based on coordinate manipulation, moving towards the 
player as they progress through the stage. RGB manipulation was also used to shift color brightness as tiles approach the foreground.
